\section{Implementation}
In upcoming section following expressions will be used:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
$n$ & number of nodes\\
$m$ & number of edges \\
$z$ & number of zones\\
$N$ & number of path computed for one pair of zone
\end{tabular}

Transportation modelling described in previous section was implemented in Python programming language using NumPy library.

\subsection{Static shortest path search}
For determined $C$ we use Dijkstra's algorithm (complexity $O(m +n log(n) )$). So final complexity is 
$$z (m + n log(n))$$
For traffic count we used also Dijkstra's algorithm. Final complexity for traffic count is 
$$N z (m + n log(n))$$
For Dijkstra's algorithm we used Python library iGraph. iGraph is written in C programming language so it is quite fast. For example one Dijkstra running 30 ms ($n = 8000$ $m = 18000$).

\subsection{Data store}
All data for transportation modelling are stored in relation database PostgreSQL with extension PostGIS. In database there are 4 main table:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
Table name & \\
\hline
\hline
\textbf{roads} & road links (edges)\\
\textbf{nodes} & nodes (vertexes)\\
\textbf{zones} & list of zones\\ 
\textbf{traffic} & \\
\textbf{general\_area\_information} & contains interested area geometry\\
\textbf{od\_pair} & Database implementation for $T$ matrix\\
\end{tabular}

More details about DB you can find in project documentation on GitHub.

\subsection{Future work}
This problem is very hard ($O(N z (m + n log(n)))$), so it is suitable compute this problem in some parallel environment (shared or distributed memory).
